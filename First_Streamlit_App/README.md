# Multiplication Table App

Welcome to my first Streamlit application! This simple yet functional app generates and displays the multiplication table for any number input by the user. With an intuitive interface, users can easily input a number and instantly view its multiplication table up to 10 times that number.

## 📁 Overview

This application demonstrates the basics of building a Streamlit app, including handling user input and displaying dynamic content. It's an excellent starting point for understanding how to create interactive web applications using Python and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Input**: Enter any number to generate its multiplication table.
- **Dynamic Display**: View the multiplication table from 1 up to 10 times the input number.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiplicationTableApp.git
